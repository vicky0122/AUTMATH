  <h1>Integers</h1>
  
  <p>An integer is a number with no decimal or fractional part, from the set of negative and positive numbers, including zero.<br>
    Examples of integers are: -5, 0, 1, 5, 8, 97, and 3,043.<br>
    A set of integers, which is represented as Z, includes:<br>
  </p>
<ul>
<li>Positive Integers: An integer is positive if it is greater than zero. Example: 1, 2, 3 . . .</li>
<li>Negative Integers: An integer is negative if it is less than zero. Example: -1, -2, -3 . . .</li>
<li>Zero is defined as neither negative nor positive integer. It is a whole number.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
Z = {... -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
</p>
  <h2>Integer operations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Addition of Integers</li>
    <li>Subtraction of Integers</li>
    <li>Multiplication of Integers</li>
    <li>Division of Integers</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Addition of integers</h2>
  <p>The absolute value of an integer is a positive number, i.e., |−2| = 2 and |2| = 2.<br>
  If there is no sign in front of a number, it means that the number is positive. For example, 5 means +5.<br>
  While adding two integers, we use the following rules:<br></p>
    <ul>
      <li>When both integers have the same signs: Add the absolute values of integers, and give the same sign as that of the given integers to the result.</li>
      <li>When one integer is positive and the other is negative: Find the difference of the absolute values of the numbers and then give the sign of the larger of these numbers to the result.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2 >Example: Add the given integers: 2 + (-5) </h2>
  <p>The absolute value of 2 is 2<br>
    The absolute value of -5 is 5<br>
    Their difference (larger number - smaller number) is 5 - 2 = 3<br>
Now, among 2 and 5, 5 is the larger number and its original sign “-”.<br>
Hence, the result gets a negative sign, "-”.<br>
Therefore, 2 + (-5) = -3
